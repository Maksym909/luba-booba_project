Testing:

*Test 1: Dropdown Menu for Service Selection*
- Functional Issue Tested: The purpose of this test was to ensure the dropdown menu for service selection functions correctly. Specifically, I tested whether the menu opens as expected and dynamically updates with the correct services when a service category (such as Nails, Makeup, etc.) is selected. The test was performed across two browsers—Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge—to verify consistency and functionality on desktop platforms. Additionally, I tested the dropdown menu in mobile view within both browsers to ensure the design adapts well on smaller screens.
- Browsers Used: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge
- Outcome:
1. Google Chrome: On the desktop, the dropdown menu opened correctly and updated with the appropriate services based on the selected category. The interaction was smooth, and all options displayed as expected. Testing in the mobile view within Chrome also showed the dropdown functioning properly, with services updating dynamically and no visual or usability issues.
2. Microsoft Edge: Similar to Chrome, the dropdown menu worked seamlessly on the desktop, updating with the correct services for the selected category. The interaction was fluid, with no issues noted. In mobile view, Edge displayed the dropdown without problems, ensuring that the dynamic service list updated correctly and the user experience was smooth across devices.


*Test 2: Multimedia (Embedded Video)*
- Functional Issue Tested: The goal of this test was to ensure that the embedded YouTube video is displayed and functions properly across different browsers. Specifically, I tested whether the video plays correctly, adjusts its size responsively to fit both desktop and mobile views, and provides a smooth viewing experience without any playback or display issues. It’s important to note that an appropriate embedded link to YouTube is required for the video to play on the website. A simple link to the YouTube site will not suffice, as the video must be embedded and playable directly on the site.
- Browsers Used: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge
- Outcome of Test:
1. Google Chrome: On the desktop, the embedded video loaded and played perfectly. The video resized dynamically to fit different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth viewing experience whether on a larger desktop screen or a smaller mobile view. There were no issues with video playback or responsiveness.
2. Microsoft Edge: The video also performed well on Microsoft Edge, loading without issues and playing smoothly. It resized correctly across different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile views. There were no problems with video display or playback functionality.


*Test 3: Booking Form Submission*
- Functional Issue Tested: The objective of this test was to verify whether the booking form correctly opens Outlook with the filled-in details when the user submits the form. This ensures that users can seamlessly submit their booking information via email with all relevant details populated automatically in the email fields.
- Browsers Used: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge
- Outcome of Test:
1. Google Chrome: The booking form worked as expected. When all the required fields were filled in and the submit button was clicked, Outlook opened with the form details ready to send. Upon checking the submitted email, the details were correctly formatted as a name-value pair (e.g., fullname=Luba, email=lubaminaeva888@gmail.com, etc.), with all information displayed accurately in the email body.
2. Microsoft Edge: The booking form performed the same as in Chrome. After filling in the form and clicking submit, Outlook opened with all the correct details pre-populated in the email fields. The email format was identical, with the form details shown as a name-value pair.

   - Description: On the Cosmetics page, there is an embedded YouTube video showcasing a virtual tour of the Glamour Salon, highlighting the option to purchase cosmetics in the store, beautifully designed rooms, treatment areas, and the relaxing atmosphere. The video adjusts its size responsively to fit different screen sizes, ensuring it’s accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
